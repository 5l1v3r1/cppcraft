Fix issues with atmospheric voxel lighting
- More tests

Outsource atmospherics and torchlight to threads
- Maybe not worth, check timings
- Create lighting queue
- Create snapshot of terrain for 3x3 sectors
- Calculate lighting for center sector

Vein-like ore deposition
- Use cheapest noise
- Create varied and SEPARATE ore zones
- Simulate by disabling terrain

Resolve issues with time
- Make sure sun integrator is good
- Ability to fast-forward time using ticks
- Make sure physics doesn't use global time
- Make sure renderer uses only global time

World simulation
- Implement random ticks for each sector (near a player?)
- Liquid flow simulation
- Rivers using flow
- Generate rivers naturally
