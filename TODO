1. Fix lys problem
2. Finn løsning på cave system, lag en ekstra cave funksjon
3. Musikk per område, musikk i caves
4.

Implement post-processing in Lua
- [x] Move most of the generic stuff to post-processing in C++
- Make the post-processing callback a Lua function
- Create Lua script wrapper
- Load a Lua script, which again loads the rest (?)

Implement configuration via JSON
- [x] Add JSON git submodule
- [x] Read JSON config file
- Provide API to terrains (and other things)

Fix issues with atmospheric voxel lighting
- More tests
- [x] Pass sector around in lighting algos to improve performance
- Re-enable torchlight fill, test with lava

Implement connected textures
- [x] Make optional
- [x] Pass 3x3 array of blocks or block IDs to each texture function
- [x] 3x3 array is on the same plane as the source block
- [x] Array[4] is the source block and the center
- Add example for how it works

Vein-like ore deposition
- Use cheapest noise
- Create varied and SEPARATE ore zones
- Simulate by disabling terrain

Resolve issues with time
- Make sure sun integrator is good
- Ability to fast-forward time using ticks
- Make sure physics doesn't use global time
- Make sure renderer uses only global time

World simulation
- Implement random ticks for each sector (near a player?)
- Liquid flow simulation
- Rivers using flow
- Generate rivers naturally



Perf:
- It's possible that disabling atmospherics until at least a 3x3 is complete
  will result in better performance overall (including objects)
