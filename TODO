1. Fix lys problem
2. Finn løsning på cave system, lag en ekstra cave funksjon
3. Musikk per område, musikk i caves
4.

Implement configuration via JSON
- Add JSON git submodule
- Read JSON config file
- Provide API to terrains (and other things)

Fix issues with atmospheric voxel lighting
- More tests
- Pass sector around in lighting algos to improve performance

Implement connected textures
- [x] Make optional
- [x] Pass 3x3 array of blocks or block IDs to each texture function
- [x] 3x3 array is on the same plane as the source block
- [x] Array[4] is the source block and the center
- Add example for how it works

Vein-like ore deposition
- Use cheapest noise
- Create varied and SEPARATE ore zones
- Simulate by disabling terrain

Resolve issues with time
- Make sure sun integrator is good
- Ability to fast-forward time using ticks
- Make sure physics doesn't use global time
- Make sure renderer uses only global time

World simulation
- Implement random ticks for each sector (near a player?)
- Liquid flow simulation
- Rivers using flow
- Generate rivers naturally

Custom shaders for mods
- Rewrite shaders to be a little more variable-length
- Add custom shader for a block (eg. fresh water)
