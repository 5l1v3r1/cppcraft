Implement light correction queue
- [x] Remove skylight from all sources
- [x] Refill after removing all

Fix issues with atmospheric voxel lighting
- More tests

Implement connected textures
- [x] Make optional
- [x] Pass 3x3 array of blocks or block IDs to each texture function
- [x] 3x3 array is on the same plane as the source block
- [x] Array[4] is the source block and the center
- Add example for how it works

Vein-like ore deposition
- Use cheapest noise
- Create varied and SEPARATE ore zones
- Simulate by disabling terrain

Resolve issues with time
- Make sure sun integrator is good
- Ability to fast-forward time using ticks
- Make sure physics doesn't use global time
- Make sure renderer uses only global time

World simulation
- Implement random ticks for each sector (near a player?)
- Liquid flow simulation
- Rivers using flow
- Generate rivers naturally

Rewrite to SDL2 over a weekend
- May be annoying to create the new windowing code
- Dump BASS
