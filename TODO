1. [x] Lag quickbar
2. Lag inventory logikk
3. Fiks opp bygging
4. Legg til en desert, legg til kaktus

Tall grass
- Find a way to animate tall grass
- Use same light as below vertices to save time
- Use cross shader

Add new data tile
- Enable data channel that can cancel out shadows (emissive)

Implement inventory logic
- Add hotbar (quickbar)
- Add logic for simple interactions with widget inventories
- Work on building mechanics

Implement post-processing in Lua
- [x] Move most of the generic stuff to post-processing in C++
- Make the post-processing callback a Lua function
- Create Lua script wrapper
- Load a Lua script, which again loads the rest (?)

Fix issues with atmospheric voxel lighting
- More tests
- [x] Pass sector around in lighting algos to improve performance
- Re-enable torchlight fill, test with lava

Implement connected textures
- [x] Make optional
- [x] Pass 3x3 array of blocks or block IDs to each texture function
- [x] 3x3 array is on the same plane as the source block
- [x] Array[4] is the source block and the center
- Add example for how it works

Vein-like ore deposition
- Use cheapest noise
- Create varied and SEPARATE ore zones
- Simulate by disabling terrain

Resolve issues with time
- Make sure sun integrator is good
- Ability to fast-forward time using ticks
- Make sure physics doesn't use global time
- Make sure renderer uses only global time
- At night the world goes completely black, likely math problem

World simulation
- Implement random ticks for each sector (near a player?)
- Liquid flow simulation
- Rivers using flow
- Generate rivers naturally
